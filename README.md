# maths_julia
This is a collection of Julia codes for various topics: infinite series, oscillations, 
numerical methods for ordinary differential equations and partial differential equations.
The mathematics behind the code is explained in my book:

MINIMUM MATHEMATICS for future scientists and engineers: An inspiring self-study note.

Brief of the book:

A self-studying mathematics notebook covering high school mathematics to university mathematics. 
Topics include algebra, trigonometry, single variable calculus, vector calculus, 
variational calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, probability, numerical analysis 
and introduction to programming using Julia.
